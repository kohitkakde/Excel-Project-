# This project is all about excel 
i got the data from google(randomly). The work i done on the data was i started by cleaning the data, sorthing and filtering as per the need of insight than i used power query to trim and get a proper format of data than use pivot to get a reference with the sales and profit and i used chart for better visuality and than i created a dashboard.
